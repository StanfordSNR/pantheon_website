          Welcome to the Pantheon of Congestion Control: a community evaluation
          platform for academic research on congestion control. The Pantheon
          provides several services to the designers of congestion-control
          schemes:
          <ol>
            <li>A curated collection of 17 <b>working implementations of
              congestion-control schemes</b>, each wrapped with a Python script
              so as to expose the same interface to the calling application.
              Each scheme is continuously verified to compile and run by a CI
              system.
              <b>We welcome contributions</b> by means of a pull request from
              the academic community; these will be evaluated on a regular
              basis.
            </li>
            <li>A testbed of measurement nodes on wired and cellular networks
                in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, India, and China, and in
                cloud datacenters in the UK, USA, Japan, and Australia. Stanford
                pays for the cellular and wired service in these
                locations. <b>We regularly run all the congestion-control
                schemes</b> in different workloads (single flow, or with
                scripted cross traffic) across the network paths between the
                nodes. We host a <b>searchable archive of results.</b>
            </li>
            <li>A <b>collection of network emulators</b> (using the
              command-line mahimahi emulator) that can be used to test
              congestion-control schemes locally. These include:
              <ul>
                <li>emulators <b>calibrated to match</b> some of the above
                  network paths.
                </li>
                <li>emulators exhibiting <b>pathological
                  network behaviors</b> suggested by colleagues at Google
                  (token-bucket-based policers, severe ACK aggregation, small
                  bottleneck buffer sizes).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
